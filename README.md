# python-co_occurance_matrix

This notebook illustrates the following

1. how to create a co-occurance-matrix for bigrams (considering only the next word)
2. How to create a co-occurance-matrix for the choosen context words
3. How to create a co-occurance matrix for the choosen context words for the context window size
4. It also illustrates how to create a sparse co-occurance-matrix
5. Finally, it also illustrates how to create a co-occurance-matrix from the dataframe (referred from kaggle notebook https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/co-occurrence-matrix-plot-in-python)
